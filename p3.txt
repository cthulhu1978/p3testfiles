turnin code: cs_p3


Write a C program that uses pthreads to compute the number of prime
numbers between multiple ranges of specified low and high values,
inclusive.  Here is an example execution:

    ./p3  3 103  1000 2000  3000 4000

The first range is 3 through 103, the second is 1000 through 2000,
and the third is 3000 through 4000, all inclusive.  You can assume that
there will be no more than 4 ranges of values, implying that you will
need to create no more than 4 threads.

Note that you only count the total number of primes found in each range,
and not the actual prime numbers themselves.

The mainline program should NOT perform any of the computation.  Instead,
it should create one pthread to examine each range.

BE SURE TO HAVE THIS AS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE LINE IN YOUR PROGRAM:

    alarm(90)

Use time1 from timedemo.c in main to determine the amount of time between
starting the threads and termination of all threads.

The print should contain EXACTLY 1 LINE OF OUTPUT containing these values:
    the total time
    the total number of primes
    the number of primes in range 1
    the number of primes in range 2
    etc

An example print for the above test might be:

    0.014   281  26   135    120

where I just made up the 0.014 time.
    

As in prior projects, if the program is run with a single command-line arg
of  -hw  then it should simply print   hello world   and exit(0).


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
	tar cvf p3.tar ./p3dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring the project, I will cd to the dir containing it and type:
        rm -rf p3
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p3 as described above.
    Sample un-tar, build, and simple execution will be provided in the script
    p3testfiles/PREP.py
